/// An option used in a [SimpleDialog].
///
/// A simple dialog offers the user a choice between several options. This
/// widget is commonly used to represent each of the options. If the user
/// selects this option, the widget will call the [onPressed] callback, which
/// typically uses [Navigator.pop] to close the dialog.
///
/// The padding on a [SimpleDialogOption] is configured to combine with the
/// default [SimpleDialog.contentPadding] so that each option ends up 8 pixels
/// from the other vertically, with 20 pixels of spacing between the dialog's
/// title and the first option, and 24 pixels of spacing between the last option
/// and the bottom of the dialog.
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// ```dart
/// SimpleDialogOption(
///   onPressed: () { Navigator.pop(context, Department.treasury); },
///   child: const Text('Treasury department'),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SimpleDialog], for a dialog in which to use this widget.
///  * [showDialog], which actually displays the dialog and returns its result.
///  * [FlatButton], which are commonly used as actions in other kinds of
